# benchmark_DL
Objectives:
1) Quantifying different approaches when coding deep neural networks from scratch using numpy.
2) Exploring and tinkering with different directions in DL like curve smoothening, optimization etc.
3) Having fun !
## Vectorization_sample 
Exploring the time difference (~50%) between vectorized vs iterated computation. Try running for differnt input shapes and plottingt the rate of change of time difference WRT input size.
Run Vectorization_sample.py for the base code template

## TODO 
Coming up with curve smoothening and bias correction soon !
